            Hey there! Being a technology enthusiast, I love to build
            applications - starting from an on-paper prototype into something
            that people truly value with a keen outlook on adapting to the
            ever-changing technology industry. Professionally, my interests lie
            in the AWS cloud platform with expertise in serverless development
            through API's for high-performance functionality of web
            applications. I started out in software development since 2016 in
            the web and mobile spaces with experience across multiple domains. I
            occasionally dabble in big data and machine learning.

            We have seen the process of manual attendance that has been carried out over the years in all colleges. This manual attendance system is not only time consuming but also often results in false attendance marking. It is difficult to maintain paper and pen-based attendance sheets. So, here we have proposed an attendance monitoring system concept which will be implemented as an android application. This Android mobile application which will communicate with the database residing on a remote server. Using Packet Radio Service (GPRS) or Wi-Fi technology, this application can be connected to the database. Our system will be a user-friendly mobile application. This attendance system will be installed on teacherâ€™s smartphone. It intends to produce an interface to the teacher who would require minimal details to input for marking of attending a particular class of students. Apart from that, the application would support robust user authentication and fast transmission of information via the net service. Lecturers will log onto the application and get connected to the server. After logging, they will take attendance using a mobile phone.
